## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate a supervised learning model which predicted whether a given loan application should be classified as high or low risk. The model was trained on historic activity provided by lending services company. 

Inputs evaluated included loan size, borrower income, interest rate, and debt to income ratio. The "y" variable represented the loan status (our target), while the "X" variable represented the features (the numeric inputs needed to reach the target).

I ran two separate analysis, the first based on the original given data, then a second based on "random over-sampling". In each case the data was split into test and training sets, the Logistic Regression Model was setup, and the predictions were made. Finally, I used a Confusion Matrix to analyze the results.


Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy: 
  * Precision: 
  * Recall: 



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Accuracy: 
  * Precision: 
  * Recall: 


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
